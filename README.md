# Armas
Armas is a 3D modeler built using Processing [http://www.processing.org].

# Design Goals

Armas is designed to be a low-level 3D editor which has a code base which is simple enough for one person to understand in its entirety and therefore modify if desired.  It is suitable for educational environments, be they official educational environments or just you, wanting to learn how a 3D modeler works.  Although it is by no means a replacement for a full-featured 3D modeler, it contains all the core concepts that enable you to work with 3D models at their lowest levels.

- Easy to understand code.
- Simple operation.
- Quick to pick up and use without memorizing lists of commands.
